== HiveMQ Hello World Plugin

=== Purpose

This Hello World plugin can be used as a foundation for writing your (first) {hivemq-link}[HiveMQ] plugin. Although {hivemq-plugin-docs-archetype-link}[there is a Maven Archetype available] to generate your Hello World plugin right from the IDE, you can use this example project if you don't like to use the Archetype.

We strongly recommend to read the {hivemq-plugin-docs-link}[HiveMQ Plugin Documentation] to grasp the core concepts of HiveMQ plugin development.

=== What you'll get

This Hello World plugin implements a simple HiveMQ Callback to get you started:

* A callback when a client connects

Also, this hello world plugin can reads configurations from a properties file (and reloads it every 5 minutes).

There's a Maven profile configured which starts HiveMQ with your plugin. Just enable the profile and run the +package+ Maven phase.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to set the path to your HiveMQ installation in the +pom.xml+. There's a "FIXME:" in the +pom.xml+ to remind you of that.

The plugin is documented with javadoc which explains what's going on. Please don't forget to read the extensive {hivemq-plugin-docs-link}[HiveMQ Plugin Documentation].

=== Trying the plugin

. Execute the +package+ goal from Maven with the profile _RunWithHiveMQ_ activated. (Need help?: Consult: {maven-documentation-profile-link}[The maven documentation])
. Now HiveMQ should be running *with* your plugin installed.
. Connect with a {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice and publish something. You should see some log output.


=== Next steps

Awesome, you got your first HiveMQ plugin working. Now grab a coffee and prepare for the next steps:

* Read about the available HiveMQ callbacks {hivemq-callbacks-overview-link}[here]. (There are also low level protocol callbacks available. See {github-low-level-callbacks}[https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-spi/tree/master/src/main/java/com/dcsquare/hivemq/spi/callback/lowlevel])
* Implement a great plugin. Bring your JDBC driver and do some database fun. Integrate with your favourite web service. There are no limits :-)
* Blog about your awesome plugin. Tell us and if you like we can add your plugin to the plugin registry on http://www.hivemq.com
